## Overview

CropOpt is a machine learning-based project that helps farmers optimize their crop selection based on soil nutrient levels. By analyzing soil parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), and pH, the system predicts the best-suited crops for cultivation.

## Features

- **Smart Prediction:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the ideal crop based on soil characteristics.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple input system for farmers to provide soil parameters and receive crop recommendations.
